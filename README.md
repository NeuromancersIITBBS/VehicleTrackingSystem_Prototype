With the help of this application, you
can track the locations of the Buses and the battery-operated vehicles
of IIT Bhubaneswar inside of the campus. You can also track the the number of
unoccupied seats inside the vehicle. The location is tracked by GPS Module
and Seats occupation is monitored using Piezoelectric pressure sensors. 

The phase 2 of the project will see this work done by IoT GPS enabled camera
which will identify seats occupied using computer vision and send its location,
solving the hassle of wires and bigger equipment.

The idea is simple. Put the marker on longitude and lattitude brought by JSON.
The code complexity is due repeated monitoring by application to update location
and complicated fashion of synchronus and asynchronus data handling.
